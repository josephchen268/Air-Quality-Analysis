# Air-Quality-Analysis
Using data from: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/air-quality

## I plan on looking at a few questions to better understand the air quality (focusing on Fine Particles PM2.5).
1. Does higher density of Fine Particles lead to more deaths due to PM 2.5
2. How much do Boiler emissions and Annual vehicle miles traveled affect the levels of PM 2.5?
3. Where is the highest average PM 2.5 levels? Why?
4. How does Fine Particles (PM 2.5) change over time? (New York Overall)
